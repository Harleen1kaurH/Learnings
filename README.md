# Learnings
## Brief on my SDC Learnings
This training was centered around Frappe Framework. It is Low code, open source, web framework in Python and Javascript which eases creation of apps and webpages.<br> <br>
*So, My learning of SDC Training was creation of app and websites using Frappe Framework.* <br><br>
This was what I had thought, prior to joining this training but I am happy to confirm that this is partially true. My learnings extend far beyond this. There are lot of soft as well as core skills I have acquired from 4 week SDC Training. <br>
First and Foremost, I learned basics of MS Excel operations.<br> Secondly, I learned basics of markdown.<br> Thirdly, I dicovered the platform of Github and learnt basics of it. I learned to create repositories, publish pages and create and merge pull requests.
<br>Then I leaned about E-mail guidelines and top posting.
<br>I discovered the concept of using virtual machines to run a different OS or to create a different environment. During this training, for the first time, I had worked on Command Line Interface. <br>
I learned to install Frappe Bench on ubuntu in developer mode.<br>
I leaned basics of javascript and got rough idea of reading and undersatnding python, js and json files even without getting expertise in it.<br><br>
These are my major learnings but list of minor Learnings range wide from understanding errors on command line and debugging them to developing the habit to read documentations rather than watching youtube videos.<br>
Besides these technical skills, I was introduced to and learned the concept of<br> 
<br>*What we learn to do, we learn by doing.*<br>
<br>I learned to value my time more and to try new things.
Overall, this training added enormous value to me as well as my skillset. It was my first step of advancing towards Computer Science field.
